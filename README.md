# Human-Activity-Recognition-and-Intelligent-Attendance-Monitoring-System
A full-featured Python-based intelligent surveillance system that combines face recognition, human activity detection, attendance logging, and analytics visualization ‚Äî all in one place.
This project is ideal for employee or student tracking, performance monitoring, and secure workplace access.

# System Modules 
# 1. Admin Login Interface
File: login_page.py
Simple login page (admin / password)
‚ÄúRemember me‚Äù functionality (saves user locally)
‚ÄúForgot Password‚Äù popup UI
Loads the Main Menu on success

# 2. Main Menu Navigation
File: main_menu.py
Provides access to all major functionalities:
Activity Recognition System
Face Recognition Attendance
Total People Counter
Analytics Dashboard
Back to Login
Exit

# 3. Face Recognition-Based Attendance
File: attendance.py
# Purpose: Detect and log known persons; flag unknowns.
# How it works:
Loads known faces from the images/ folder
Captures faces in real time from webcam
Compares them to known encodings
# If Match (Authorized):
Draws green box
Shows name and ‚ÄúAuthorized‚Äù
Saves name + timestamp in Attendance.csv
Logs activity in activity_data.csv
# If No Match (Unauthorized):
Draws red box
Shows ‚ÄúUnauthorized Intrusion!‚Äù
Captures face as image: unauthorized_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg
Saves log in Unauthorized_Log.csv
# 4.Activity Recognition System
File: recognition_mode.py
# Purpose: Monitor posture, activity, and detect presence in real-time.
Detectable Activities:
| Activity        | Detection Logic                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Standing**    | Shoulders far above hips, knees low |
| **Sitting**     | Knees above hip level               |
| **Head Down**   | Nose lower than average ear level   |
| **Hands Up**    | Wrists above shoulders              |
| **Using Phone** | Wrists near face (‚â§30 cm)           |
| **Sleeping**    | Eyes closed (EAR check) + no motion |
| **Absent**      | No person detected in frame         |

# 3-Level Alert System (for Absence)
| Time Passed | Alert Displayed                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ‚è±Ô∏è 5 sec    | ‚ö†Ô∏è "Absence detected!"               |
| ‚è±Ô∏è 10 sec   | ‚ö†Ô∏è "Please return to your position!" |
| ‚è±Ô∏è 15 sec+  | üî¥ "FINAL WARNING!!" + timer shown   |


This ensures:
Gentle warning first
Stronger alert if user still missing
Timer tracks how long they‚Äôre away

# AI-Driven Behavior Logging
Every 10 seconds:
Logs total time spent per activity in activity_data.csv
Used later for charts, trends, reports

# 5. Total People Counter
File: total_people.py
Purpose: Count number of faces seen on camera using HaarCascade.
Displays:

Date & time
Total face count
Press 'b' to return to main menu

# 6. Analytics Dashboard
File: dashboard.py
Purpose: Visualize, analyze, and report performance.

Tabs:
Activity Analytics
Attendance Records
Reports
